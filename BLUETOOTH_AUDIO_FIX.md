# 🎧 Bluetooth Audio Fix - "I Can't Hear Anything" Issue

## 🚨 Problem Description

When using Bluetooth headphones/AirPods during recording, users experienced:
- **Audio suddenly switching to built-in speakers** during recording
- **Unable to hear anything** because audio was routed away from Bluetooth device
- **Audio never switching back** to Bluetooth after recording stopped
- Having to manually switch back to Bluetooth in System Settings

## 🔧 Root Cause

The issue was in the Swift recorder's Bluetooth handling logic:

1. **Automatic Device Switching**: When system audio recording was requested with Bluetooth output, the system automatically switched to built-in speakers for better system audio capture
2. **No Device Restoration**: The original Bluetooth device ID was never stored or restored after recording
3. **User Left Without Audio**: Users were left with audio going to speakers they might not be using

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Smart Device Tracking**
- **Store Original Device**: Before switching, the system now stores your original Bluetooth device ID and name
- **Clear User Communication**: Better messages explaining what's happening and why

### 2. **Automatic Restoration**
- **Post-Recording Restoration**: When recording stops, audio is automatically switched back to your original Bluetooth device
- **Emergency Cleanup**: Even if the app crashes, a cleanup mechanism tries to restore your audio
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages confirming when audio has been restored

### 3. **Manual Recovery Tool**
- **Standalone Script**: `fix-bluetooth-audio.swift` can be run if audio gets stuck
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds and switches back to Bluetooth devices
- **Interactive Mode**: Lets you choose which Bluetooth device to use if multiple are available

## 🎯 What You'll See Now

### Before Recording Starts:
```
🎧 Bluetooth output detected - this will temporarily affect system audio capture
💡 To capture system audio, we need to temporarily switch to built-in speakers
🔄 Your audio will be automatically restored to Bluetooth after recording stops
📱 Storing original device: 'Dor's AirPods 4' for later restoration
✅ Switched to built-in speakers for recording
🎧 Don't worry - your Bluetooth audio will be restored when recording stops
```

### After Recording Stops:
```
🔄 Restoring original audio output device...
✅ Audio restored to: 'Dor's AirPods 4'
🎧 You should now hear audio through your Bluetooth device again
```

## 🛠️ Manual Fix (If Needed)

If your audio ever gets stuck on speakers, run:

```bash
swift fix-bluetooth-audio.swift
```

The script will:
1. Check your current audio device
2. Find available Bluetooth devices
3. Automatically switch back to your Bluetooth device
4. Confirm the restoration

Example output:
```
🔧 Bluetooth Audio Restoration Tool
===================================
📱 Current audio device: 'MacBook Pro Speakers'
🔗 Is Bluetooth: false
🔍 Searching for Bluetooth devices to restore...
🎧 Found 1 Bluetooth device(s):
  1. 'Dor's AirPods 4' (ID: 85)
🔄 Automatically switching to: 'Dor's AirPods 4'
✅ Successfully switched audio to: 'Dor's AirPods 4'
🎧 You should now hear audio through your Bluetooth device!
```

## 🔄 Technical Changes Made

### Swift Recorder (`Recorder.swift`)
- Added `originalOutputDeviceID` and `hasBluetoothSwitching` tracking variables
- Enhanced device switching logic with better user communication
- Added `restoreOriginalAudioDevice()` method called during recording finish
- Added emergency cleanup in `deinit` for unexpected termination

### Audio Device Manager (`AudioDeviceManager.swift`)
- Added `getCurrentDefaultOutputDevice()` method for device detection
- Added `getDeviceName()` method for user-friendly device names
- Enhanced device switching with verification and better error handling

### Main App (`index.ts`)
- Updated audio device management to use the restoration script
- Better integration between frontend and audio device control
- Real-time audio device status checking

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Seamless Experience**: Audio automatically switches back after recording
2. **Never Lose Audio**: Multiple safety nets ensure you always get your audio back
3. **Clear Communication**: Always know what's happening with your audio devices
4. **Manual Recovery**: If anything goes wrong, easy fix is available
5. **Smart Detection**: System intelligently handles different Bluetooth device scenarios

## ⚡ Quick Test

Want to verify the fix works? Here's how:

1. **Connect Bluetooth headphones/AirPods**
2. **Start a recording with system audio** 
3. **Notice the clear messages** about temporary switching
4. **Stop the recording**
5. **Confirm audio is restored** to your Bluetooth device

Your audio should seamlessly return to your Bluetooth device with clear confirmation messages!
